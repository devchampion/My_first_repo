    <ul style="color:white;">
        <li><strong>Practicising Debugging:</strong> <blockquote>To debug,since i know the tags and the expected output,i tried to look for what is not in it right mannerand crosschecked the tag responsible for it,then I tracked the tag down and checked if i used it correctly</blockquote></li>
        
        <li><strong>Revising The Git Controls:</strong> <blockquote>I learnt some new git controls or let me say some new git commands alongside with refreshing my memory with the little git commands i new before that day of revision.Just exactly what you said,"When you know 1 and you are moving to 2.When you are using 2,try to use 1 too, on other not to forget."</blockquote></li>
        
        <li><strong>Fixing Errors:</strong> <blockquote>I fixed some errors i made in some of my previous coding like correcting the spaces i put when naming my file and closing some of the tags i didn't close then finally i fixed the position of my last paragraph.</blockquote> </li>
        
        <li><strong>Learn about attribute:</strong>At first when I read about these attribute,I did not really have a solid understanding about it until the best programmer (Mr. Temidayo) in the world explained them to me.Now, I not only know, but understand them.E.g src,href,alt,height,width.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Image Tags:</strong> <blockquote>Okay,these are the image tags i know.e.g src,height,width,pixel etc.</blockquote></li>
        
        <li><strong>Anchor Tags:</strong><blockquote>I really don't know much.</blockquote></li>
